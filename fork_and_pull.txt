One way to do development

See https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
and https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

1. Each user forks the repo
2. Does development in their own repo/branch.
   a. it isn't strictly necessary to do development in another branch.  However, it would allow you 
      to be able to use this personal repo to switch to the same state as the main repo.  
3. Pushes code to the main tree via pull request.
4. Reviews can happen during pull-request processing.

Here's what I just did...

Forked via gui
$ git clone git@github.com:rogerallen/test.git
$ cd test
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:osu-capstone-nvidia-project-2013/test.git

$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge origin master

$ git branch rallen_dev
$ git checkout rallen_dev

$ git add <files>
$ git commit -m "message"
$ git push origin rallen_dev

Then, I'll do a pull request on github
