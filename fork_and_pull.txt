One way to do development (this is under discussion)

See https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
and https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

1. Each user forks the repo (via gui)
2. Does development in their own repo/branch.
3. Pushes code to the main tree via pull request.
4. Reviews can happen during pull-request processing.
